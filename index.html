                <p>I was born and raised in sunny Portugal and currently live in Porto (which isn‚Äôt always so sunny üåßÔ∏è). I enjoy working at the intersection of Machine Learning, Product, and Engineering, building products that meaningfully impact users' lives.</p>
<p>I currently lead Applied AI at <a href="https://swordhealth.com/">Sword Health</a> where we‚Äôre reinventing how patients access and receive care‚Äîmaking treatment more human, clinically effective, and scalable. My focus is on building and scaling machine learning systems that drive Sword‚Äôs mission of freeing 2 million people from pain.</p>
<p>When I joined Sword Health, the entire company could fit into a single office room in downtown Porto. Today, we‚Äôve grown to over 1k with offices in Porto, Lisbon, and NYC.</p>
<p>Some of my (and my team‚Äôs) contributions so far, in reverse chronological order, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Co-organizing <a href="https://aisummit.swordhealth.com/">Sword AI Summit</a> 2025 - happening November 15th (if you want to attend register <a href="https://my.weezevent.com/sword-ai-summit-2025">here</a>).</li>
<li>Post-training (SFT/RLHF/RLAIF) of LLMs on anonymized proprietary health data, optimized to maximize clinical outcomes.</li>
<li>Building Gondola, a human feedback interface powering evaluation cycles.</li>
<li>Designing and launched the 10+ AI features behind the AI Feed, Sword‚Äôs core care-management system that supports clinical decision-making, engagement, and administrative workflows, supporting scale without compromising quality of care</li>
<li>Building <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiIGIfciEFA&amp;ab_channel=SwordHealth">Phoenix</a>, a clinically safe, context-aware, and engaging voice agent (built by combining STT, LLM and TTSmodels) that guides therapy sessions and sustains member engagement.</li>
<li>Creating the AI Care Coordinator, which resolves incoming member support tickets across email, chat, and SMS</li>
<li>Growing the Applied AI team from 3 to 20+ team members, leading 3 sub-teams</li>
<li>Co-organizing and presenting at the <a href="https://aisummit.swordhealth.com/">Sword AI Summit</a> 2024,  with ~700 attendees (pulled together in under two months üòÖ)</li>
<li>Co-inventor of 10+ <a href="https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Ana+Clara+FERREIRA+MATOS">patents</a></li>
<li>Building human motion tracking and analysis models that have already powered 7M+ AI Care Sessions</li>
<li>‚Ä¶and other random things you‚Äôd expect (and not expect) in a fast-growing startup üöÄ</li>
</ul>
<p>Although building machine learning products in healthcare at scale is cool nothing tops receiving feedback like <a href="https://swordhealth.com/resources/member-stories">this</a> ü•π.</p>
<p>I studied Biomedical Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto (<a href="https://www.up.pt/feup/pt/">FEUP</a>). For my <a href="https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/bitstream/10216/80368/2/36447.pdf">master‚Äôs thesis</a>, I developed a computer vision model for human motion tracking, well before off-the-shelf models became a commodity.</p>
<p>When I‚Äôm not working you can find me traveling, reading, hiking, planning DIY projects that might not get started (or finished), exploring <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/BM6Dx78KcuCcsZjz6">new restaurants</a> or saving my feet from the bites of my 6-month-old kitten, Flecha.</p>
